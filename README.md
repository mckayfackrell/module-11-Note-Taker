## Usage

When the user opens Nate Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. After clicking the link, the user is presented with a page containing a column on the left and the right. The left is for the notes already taken and the right is for taking new notes.

The user also has a "+" button in the top right that acts as a new note button. After typing in the information the user would like to store in the note they can then save the note by pressing the save button next to the "+" button.

The list on the left continues to grow as the user makes new notes. The user can click on any note in the left column to populate that note in the right column for editing or viewing purposes.
